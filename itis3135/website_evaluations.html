        <h2>Website Evaluation</h2>
        <section class="rollpark">
            <h3><a href="https://rollpark.us/" target="_blank">Rollpark Website</a></h3>
            <p>
                This website is for a buisness called Rollpark. They are a company that offers a service, specifically they provide geotextile material that can be rolled out and used as parking. It very useful for large scale events or other situation where extra parking is required. 
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Contrast: I feel that this website does a great job of blending both the sizing and colors of the text. It combines various aspects of the page in pleasing manner and effectively communicates it through its aesthetics.</li>
                <li>Repitition: This page uses consistent color schemes and font styles which allows for a uniform and pleasing look. Even the details help unifying the work in its entirety.</li>
                <li>Allignment: While not implicitly marked, you can make out the allignment of the webpage in the formating of the different elements. It well structured in regards to its organization and helps in grouping different topics</li>
                <li>Proximity: While not perfect, I do think this website effectively groups its information by putting similar subjects around each other to make it easier for the user to follow the text.</li>
            </ul>

        <section class="yaleArt">
            <h3><a href="https://www.art.yale.edu/" target="_blank">Yale's Art Website</a></h3>
            <p>
                This website is created with the intention of informing viewers of the Yale School of Art. It does have an interesting take on the website as it allows anybody to change various aspects of the website meaning it is for the creativity of the community.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Contrast: I feel that this website struggles in effectively contrasting the colors and overall the every aspect. It is more a vomit of colors and text.</li>
                <li>Repitition: There is no repitition within this website. Everthing seems random and has to sense of uniformity.</li>
                <li>Allignment: There is sort of area that the all information is lined up with but none of that information follows the actual line. All the elements are kind of thrown into the area without actually being fit into the expected area</li>
                <li>Proximity: As stated earlier, much of this is a sort of vomit of different information and thus has no sense of unification. It is hard to make out where to go for different information.</li>
