        <h3>Project Travel Through Space (Work in progress)</h3>
        <section class="projectInfo">
            <h4>Project Overview</h4>
            <p>With Project <em>Travel Through Space</em> my client intends to create a webpage primarily focused on space exploration. They hope this will allow the youth to get insight into astronomy and many of the wonders within our universe. The intended users are primarily youth but are not limitied to them as Project <em>Travel Through Space</em> hopes to spread this knowledge to anyone willing to seek it. It will contain information about our solar system and hope to expand even further beyond...</p>

            <h4>Dynamic Functionality</h4>
            <p>For this project there will be a large amount of JavaScript needed. The largest one being the Our Solar System interactive tour. The hope is that by scrolling and clicking will greatly affect what is seen on the screen. Another is the slideshow style representation of news article and other images. These are the primary one though there may be other smaller implementations.</p>
