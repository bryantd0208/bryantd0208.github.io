            <h4 class="reviewHeading">The Good</h4>
            <ul class="reviewList">
                <li>Great contrast along with colors. Visuals are important and yours definitely achieves the perfect balance</li>
                <li>Simplicity many times is key and you have done a great job of not overfilling your page with unnecessary stuff</li>
                <li>All pages seemed to have great build and allow for easy accesses and traversal for the user</li>
            </ul>
            <h4 class="reviewHeading">The Bad</h4>
            <ul class="reviewList">
                <li>While this is not a big deal the nav bar being underlined takes away from its purpose. If it where to be underlined maybe through a hover effect or some other manner but not always underlined</li>
                <li>The polygon does not match the same as all the others and does not work as intended by the requirments of the assigment</li>
            </ul>
            <h4 class="reviewHeading">The Ugly</h4>
            <ul class="reviewList">
                <li>Navagation menu on many pages seems cluttered and this is due to the amount of links along with the selected font size and divider. I recommend finding a potential more clean way to have these links as in its current state it looks more like a blob of text.</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="bold">Other than those issues your website is great and I love the simplicity which ties everything together!</p>
