                <h3>The Power of Curiosity</h3>
                <p>
                    Studies have shown that curiosity makes our brains more receptive to learning, and that as we learn, we enjoy the sensation of learning. Thats why we also want to provide you with links to various forms of media where you can take it into your own hands to learn! There are countless ways to get new information but we went with ones that you can include in your every day life! These forms are:
                    <ul>
                        <li>E-Books: Easy on the go reading for long trips or just to pass the time!</li>
                        <li>Podcast: Great portability and can be listened to when doing any activity!</li>
                        <li>Apps: Interactive forms of learning that allow for a more visual experience!</li>
                        <li>Sound bits: When you can't get enough of space these are great!</li>
                    </ul>
