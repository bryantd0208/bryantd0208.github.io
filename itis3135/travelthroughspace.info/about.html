                    There are countless resources on the internet but no direct way for people to access them with out constant searching. With Project Travel Through Space we hope to offer a platform where everyone can find information about Astronomy through up-to-date news articles and other forms of media. We believe that curiousity is key to learning and by providing you with resources we can help spark curioisty within those who want to explore.
