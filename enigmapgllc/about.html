    <h1>About Us</h1>
    <p>Enigma PG is a small company with over three years of experience in resin design work. The idea for Enigma PG came after the owner was asked to help with a never-before-done design resin project. Although the project fell through, the planning and consideration that went into it helped inspire the idea of creating pieces of beautiful and unique resin. Enigma PG prides itself on creating stunning imitation resin work using different colors, textures, and finishes. We are a company that seeks to meet the needs of your project by providing guidance and ideas to help you carry out your project. Resin is an art. Let us know how we can help you bring your artistic visions to life.</p>
